# CareBot-Healthcare-Assistant
CareBot – Healthcare Assistant is an innovative data-driven healthcare project designed to assist doctors, pharmacists, and patients by analyzing medical prescriptions intelligently.
The system leverages machine learning and data analytics to detect potential drug interactions, anomalies, dosage errors, and provide personalized health insights based on patient records.

In today’s healthcare systems, managing prescriptions manually often leads to human errors and inefficiencies. CareBot addresses these issues by offering automated prescription validation, risk analysis, and real-time recommendations, ensuring improved patient safety and clinical decision-making.

The project combines the power of machine learning models for predictive analytics with data visualization to help users easily interpret healthcare data and trends.
